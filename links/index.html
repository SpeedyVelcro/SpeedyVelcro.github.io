<h2>Cool People with Cool Websites</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://freckleskies.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/assets/images/banners/freckleskies.gif" alt="freckleskies.net"></img></a> - Good friend I met in university who makes cool art and has a kickass neocities page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communities</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newgrounds</a> - Great website full of varied art of many different mediums. Newgrounds has excellent discovery systems - I've had very good luck with publishing my games there. I would recommend you give it a shot.</li>
	<li>YoYoGames Sandbox - IF IT STILL EXISTED!!! The YYG Sandbox was the best place for truly innovative indie games on the net - all made with GameMaker. An avant-garde community like nothing else out there, and it's a shame we lost it. Instead, visit the <a href="https://yygarchive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YoYoGames Sandbox Archive</a> to play the games, which have thankfully been preserved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Engine</a> - Extremely good open-source game engine. Overall has a very elegant design and a lot of useful features which are great for productivity when developing games at the "polished indie" kind of level that I try to work at. In particular the UI system is to die for, and saves me so much time making menus.</li>
	<li><a href="https://gamemaker.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameMaker</a> - The game engine I started with, and I still think it's probably the best starting point if you want to learn game development.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.reaper.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cockos REAPER</a> - Excellent professional DAW (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Wikipedia link</a> if you're unfamiliar with the term) with a less predatory licensing model than most of the industry. This is what I use to make music.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audacity</a> - You all know it, you all love it. This is a swiss-army-knife of audio that I use for quick edits.</li>
	<li><a href="https://tytel.org/helm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helm</a> - Really good free, open source, and cross-platform synth. Has a really user-friendly interface too so it's great for learning about sound synthesis.</li>
	<li><a href="https://kdenlive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kdenlive</a> - Free and open source cross-platform video editing software. It's no Premiere, but it's incredibly easy to use and it's good enough for my purposes. Just don't ask me how to say it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBS</a> - Free, open source, cross-platform, and highly-capable screen capture software (among other things). I wish I could go back in time and tell little me who wanted to be a YouTuber that he didn't need to pay for <a href="https://fraps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fraps</a>.<sup>(Follow the link to Fraps at your own peril)</sup></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vim</a> - Command line text editor. Some doors, once opened, can never be closed.</li>
	<li><a href="https://apps.kde.org/en-gb/kolourpaint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kolourpaint</a> - Do you frequently find yourself thinking "I sure do love Linux but man I wish this thing had MSPaint"? Well boy do I have just the tool for you. You know you're dealing with great software when the feature list includes "Support for drawing various shapes - lines, rectangles, rounded rectangles, ovals and polygons".<sup>No joke, unironically I love this program</sup></li>
</ul>
