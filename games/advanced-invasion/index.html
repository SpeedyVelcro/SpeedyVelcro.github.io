title: "Advanced Invasion"
---
<p>Advanced Invasion is a casual platformer with a fast-paced story made as a spiritual successor to an obscure classic on the YoYoGames sandbox, Virus Invasion by blublub. It's also a reboot to the identically-named spiritual successor I made at the time under the name SpeedyVelcro.</p>
