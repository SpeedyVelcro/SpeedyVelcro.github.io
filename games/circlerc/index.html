<p>CircleRC is a top-down time-trial game where you control a small remote control car that can only steer left and right. Circle around objectives to capture them, and get to the flag in the shortest time possible!</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™m working on a big update to flesh out the game with extra levels, after which I hope to port it to Newgrounds and Game Jolt with high score support.</p>
