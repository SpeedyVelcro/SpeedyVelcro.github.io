Hi folks, just adding a blog to this site since I figured there was
a gaping blog-shaped hole on it that needed filling. I'll be adding
posts as I work on stuff; I should have some stuff in the pipeline!

By the way, this blog is RSS-enabled. You can access the RSS feed
<a href="/feed.xml">here</a>. (Well, technically it's an atom feed, but
that's more or less the same thing.)  Or if that sounds too complicated
for you, there's always my
<a href="/social">social media accounts</a>. But I any time I make a
post it's guaranteed to show up on the RSS feed, so that's really the
best way.
