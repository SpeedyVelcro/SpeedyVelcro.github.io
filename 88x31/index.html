<p>Want to link to my website? Consider using an 88x31 banner (you can read about 88x31 banners <a href="https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Here's mine:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/images/speedyvelcro-88x31.png" alt="88x31 speedyvelcro.com banner"></img></div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="/assets/images/speedyvelcro-88x31.png" download>Download</a></p>

<p>If you are curious you can also <a href="/assets/images/speedyvelcro-88x31.xcf" download>download the source file</a> which can be edited in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIMP</a>, though it's not that interesting so I really wouldn't bother.</p>

<p>To use the banner as a link to my website, you can copy the following snippet of HTML (remember to change the path to where the image is stored on your site):</p>

<pre>&lt;a href="https://speedyvelcro.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/path/to/image/speedyvelcro-88x31.png" alt="speedyvelcro.com"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>You may use this image under the terms of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>. Alternatively, you may distribute, use, display, perform, and/or share the image unmodified for any and all purposes - including commercial - in perpituity, for free, and without any attribution requirements.</p>

<p>(Non-binding, not legal advice: this basicallly means, yeah, you can put this image on your website)</p>
